    <h1>Hello! My name is Mariia Parfeniuk 👋</h1>
    <h2>👩‍💻 About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a Test Automation Engineer with 5 years of hands-on experience in building and maintaining UI and API tests.
      My main tools are JavaScript and TypeScript, and I focus on writing reliable, readable, and maintainable tests
      that integrate seamlessly into CI/CD workflows. I enjoy sharing practical insights, real-world lessons, and a bit
      of humor from the world of automated testing.
